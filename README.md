VNC Dispatcher - for raspberry pi

This is a simple dispatcher for VNC servers.

Honestly, this has nothing to do with RaspberryPI, 
 but... read-on.

I'm looking for a simple server-dispacher that can run on
 any computer that is able to reach the internet,
 and is able to discover any running VNC server inside
 a private network.

The plan here is to set up a simple PC (a Raspberry Pi
 for example) install a VPN, run this server-dispatcher,
 then on the other side of the VPN, run a viewer-manager,
 and the viewer-manager can reach out through the VPN and
 any other network connection, and discover any running
 server dispatcher. The viewer-dispatcher then allows a user
 to merely click-on any remote VNC server, and connect to
 it.
